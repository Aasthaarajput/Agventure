# 🌱 Agventure – IoT-based Smart Agriculture System  

## 📌 Overview  
Agventure is an **IoT-enabled smart agriculture solution** designed to help farmers monitor and manage crops efficiently.  
It uses sensors like **soil moisture, temperature, and humidity**, combined with **Arduino/ESP32**, to provide **real-time farm insights**.  
The system enables **automated irrigation**, **data logging**, and **cloud monitoring**, making agriculture smarter, more productive, and sustainable.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Automate **irrigation based on soil moisture** levels.  
- Provide **real-time monitoring** of farm parameters.  
- Reduce **water and resource wastage**.  
- Integrate with **IoT dashboards** for remote access.  
- Support **data-driven decisions** for better yield.

## ⚙️ Working Principle  
1. **Sensors** (Soil Moisture, DHT11/DHT22 for temperature & humidity) collect farm data.  
2. Data is processed by **Arduino/ESP32 microcontroller**.  
3. If soil moisture is low, **relay activates a water pump** for irrigation.  
4. Data is displayed on an **LCD screen** and uploaded to an **IoT platform**.  
5. Farmers can monitor conditions via a **web/mobile dashboard**.
